# Decentralized Cloud System

Our idea solves the problem of the central cloud system which exists in the market. Lots of storage and computing power are getting wasted. Many people with a wide range of high tech computers end up using small amount of RAM and storage and some do not using such high end infra which is available with them. So, why not combine these computers and laptops of people to provide the specs as that provided by EC2 instance at much cheaper rates. Our solution is to make a decentralized cloud system using Hadoop, Spark, Dockers, Linux, ETC and Solidity in which everyone can pool in his/her resources (i.e. both RAM, GPU and storage), in exchange for an ETC Coin and the resources can be used as an AWS EC2 and S3 instance. This platform caters to 2 types of people, one who wants to store the data and others who want to give its system for the services. The former one is charged a minimal amount in our cryptocurrencies and the later one receives payment in the same form. Here, the consensus takes care of the different malpractices such as running away with data, not coming online etc. Also, every process that we run on other people system is containerized using dockers and hence security is guaranteed.
 We'll be notifying our users using Realtime messaging API, Ably. Hence, providing realtime updates to everyone.


TECH: Hadoop-Spark Cluster, Linux, ETC and Solidity, Python3, Blockchain using Ethereum, Shell-Script, GIT
